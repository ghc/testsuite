    Could not deduce (Memo d0 ~ Memo d)
    from the context (Fun d)
      bound by the type signature for f :: Fun d => Memo d a -> Memo d a
      at NoMatchErr.hs:19:7-37
    NB: ‛Memo’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‛d0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: Memo d a -> Memo d a
      Actual type: Memo d0 a -> Memo d0 a
    In the ambiguity check for:
      forall d a. Fun d => Memo d a -> Memo d a
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‛f’: f :: Fun d => Memo d a -> Memo d a
