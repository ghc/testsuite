    Could not deduce (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)
                      ~ t0 (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)))

      bound by the instance declaration at T7729a.hs:26:10-42
    The type variable ‛t0’ is ambiguous
    Expected type: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a
      Actual type: t0 (BasePrimMonad (Rand m)) a
    Relevant bindings include
      x :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a (bound at T7729a.hs:28:12)
      liftPrim :: BasePrimMonad (Rand m) a -> Rand m a
        (bound at T7729a.hs:28:3)
    In the first argument of ‛liftPrim’, namely ‛(lift x)’
    In the expression: liftPrim (lift x)
