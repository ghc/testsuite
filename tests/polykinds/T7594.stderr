    Couldn't match type ‛b’ with ‛IO ()’
      ‛b’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints ((:&:) c0 Real a)
        bound by a type expected by the context: (:&:) c0 Real a => a -> b
        at T7594.hs:33:8-19
      ‛b’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of bar2 :: b at T7594.hs:33:1
    Expected type: a -> b
      Actual type: a -> IO ()
    Relevant bindings include bar2 :: b (bound at T7594.hs:33:1)
    In the first argument of ‛app’, namely ‛print’
    In the expression: app print q2
