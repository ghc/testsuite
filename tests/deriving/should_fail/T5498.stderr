    Could not coerce from ‛c a’ to ‛c (Down a)’
      because ‛c a’ and ‛c (Down a)’ are different types.
      arising from the coercion of the method ‛intIso’ from type
                   ‛forall (c :: * -> *). c a -> c Int’ to type
                   ‛forall (c :: * -> *). c (Down a) -> c Int’
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (IntIso (Down a))
