    Can't make a derived instance of ‛IsInt Moo’
      (even with cunning newtype deriving):
      it is not type-safe to use GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving on this class;
      ‛isInt’, at type ‛forall (c :: * -> *).
                        c Int -> c t’, cannot be converted safely
    In the newtype declaration for ‛Moo’
