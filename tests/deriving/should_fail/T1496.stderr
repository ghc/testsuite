    Could not coerce from ‛c Int’ to ‛c Moo’
      because ‛c Int’ and ‛c Moo’ are different types.
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (IsInt Moo)
