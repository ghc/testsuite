    No instance for (GHC.Types.Coercible (c1 Int) (c1 Moo))
      because ‛c1 Int’ and ‛c1 Moo’ are different types.
      arising from a use of ‛GHC.Prim.coerce’
    In the expression:
        GHC.Prim.coerce (isInt :: c Int -> c Int) ::
          forall (c :: * -> *). c Int -> c Moo
    In an equation for ‛isInt’:
        isInt
          = GHC.Prim.coerce (isInt :: c Int -> c Int) ::
              forall (c :: * -> *). c Int -> c Moo
