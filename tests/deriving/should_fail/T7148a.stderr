    Could not coerce from ‛Result a b’ to ‛b’
      because ‛Result a b’ and ‛b’ are different types.
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Convert (IS_NO_LONGER a))
