    No instance for (GHC.Types.Coercible (T Int) (T A))
      because the first type argument of ‛T’ has role Nominal,
      but the arguments ‛Int’ and ‛A’ differ
      arising from a use of ‛GHC.Prim.coerce’
    In the expression: GHC.Prim.coerce (ic :: T Int) :: T A
    In an equation for ‛ic’: ic = GHC.Prim.coerce (ic :: T Int) :: T A
    In the instance declaration for ‛C A’
