CasePrune.hs:14:31:
    Could not coerce from ‛T Int’ to ‛T A’
      because the first type argument of ‛T’ has role Nominal,
      but the arguments ‛Int’ and ‛A’ differ
      arising from the coercion of the method ‛ic’ from type ‛T Int’
                   to type ‛T A’
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (C A)
