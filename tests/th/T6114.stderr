    The exact Name ‛x’ is not in scope
      Probable cause: you used a unique Template Haskell name (NameU), 
      perhaps via newName, but did not bind it
      If that's it, then -ddump-splices might be useful
    In the argument of reifyInstances: GHC.Classes.Eq x_0
    In the splice:
      $(do { xName <- newName "x";
             instanceType <- [t| $(varT xName) |];
             _ <- reifyInstances ''Eq [instanceType];
             .... })
