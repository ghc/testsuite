    Couldn't match type ‛a’ with ‛[a]’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for f :: A a -> a at T7861.hs:10:6
    Expected type: A a -> a
      Actual type: A a -> [a]
    Relevant bindings include f :: A a -> a (bound at T7861.hs:11:1)
    In the expression: doA
    In an equation for ‛f’: f = doA
