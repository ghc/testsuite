    Couldn't match expected type ‛a’ with actual type ‛Maybe t0’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for test :: a -> r -> () at T7748a.hs:11:9
    Relevant bindings include
      zd :: a (bound at T7748a.hs:12:6)
      test :: a -> r -> () (bound at T7748a.hs:12:1)
    In the pattern: Nothing
    In a case alternative: Nothing -> const ()
    In the expression:
      case zd of {
        Nothing -> const ()
        Just Nothing -> const ()
        Just (Just p) -> p }
