    Could not deduce (Bar a0 r)
      arising from the ambiguity check for ‛bar’
    from the context (Bar a r)
      bound by the type signature for bar :: Bar a r => r -> ()

    The type variable ‛a0’ is ambiguous
    In the ambiguity check for: forall r a. Bar a r => r -> ()
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‛bar’: bar :: Bar a r => r -> ()
