T8450.hs:8:20:
    Couldn't match type ‛a’ with ‛Bool’
      ‛a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for run :: a at T8450.hs:7:15
    Expected type: Either Bool ()
      Actual type: Either a ()
    Relevant bindings include run :: a (bound at T8450.hs:8:1)
    In the second argument of ‛($)’, namely
      ‛(undefined :: Either a ())’
    In the expression: runEffect $ (undefined :: Either a ())
    In an equation for ‛run’:
        run = runEffect $ (undefined :: Either a ())
