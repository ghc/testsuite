    Couldn't match expected type ‛Prelude.Maybe a’
                with actual type ‛Maybe t0’
    NB: ‛Prelude.Maybe’ is defined in ‛Data.Maybe’ in package ‛base’
        ‛Maybe’ is defined at tcfail182.hs:6:1-18
    Relevant bindings include
      f :: Prelude.Maybe a -> Int (bound at tcfail182.hs:9:1)
    In the pattern: Foo
    In an equation for ‛f’: f Foo = 3
