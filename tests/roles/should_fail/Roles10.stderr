    Could not coerce from ‛Bool’ to ‛Char’
      because ‛Bool’ and ‛Char’ are different types.
      arising from the coercion of the method ‛meth’ from type
                   ‛Int -> F Int’ to type ‛Age -> F Age’
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (C Age)
