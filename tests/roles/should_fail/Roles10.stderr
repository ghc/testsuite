    No instance for (GHC.Types.Coercible Bool Char)
      because ‛Bool’ and ‛Char’ are different types.
      arising from a use of ‛GHC.Prim.coerce’
    In the expression:
        GHC.Prim.coerce (meth :: Int -> F Int) :: Age -> F Age
    In an equation for ‛meth’:
        meth = GHC.Prim.coerce (meth :: Int -> F Int) :: Age -> F Age
    In the instance declaration for ‛C Age’
